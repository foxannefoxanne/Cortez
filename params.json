We now have fully fleshed mobile and web applications which  are able to communicate with each other.\r\n\r\nThe web application first implemented a map and pin system. The map uses Google map so  the user can explore different locations across the globe. The on-click pin system allows map creators to mark points of interest on the map with a description and add accompanying media (pictured, audio, video, or text). Combined, these two systems provide an interface for curators to build custom maps suited to their needs and interests. The web interface also creates JSON interfaces to export to the mobile console. \r\n\r\nOn the mobile app, we have designed a system for displaying the maps created from the web frontend. A Google map displays the pins, which can be selected to display their associated information. This map ties into the device’s GPS functionality, allowing the user to navigate the map in real time, walking from pin to pin. The pins will pop in and out as the user views relevant portions of the map. The pins themselves are pulled from a local JSON file. This means that the user will be able to choose which map to use (which will tie into the map and pin system being developed on the web application).\r\n\r\n## What problems did we have?\r\nThe latest hurdle to web app creation was the implementation of S3 into the Heroku component. Heroku would not save the long term media elements (images, video, audio) that we required with our current Rails gem, Paperclip. As such, we had to implement an AWS S3 component to store these items. \r\n\r\nThe mobile app hasn’t been without its share of difficulties, either. Android documentation is sometimes confusing or out of date, requiring our developers to be especially wary of using deprecated function calls. Throughout development, we have continued to experience temperamental behavior of Android Studio (the official IDE) across differing platforms.\r\n\r\nThe app has called for an ever-increasing list of concepts and Java boilerplate:\r\n* Android application lifecycle (onCreate, onStart, onPause, onStop), and order of execution that resembles programming for embedded systems\r\n* Network handling, and asynchronous downloading tasks in RESTful fashion\r\n* Context switching using Android Intent and BroadcastReceiver, and data / parameter passing across those contexts for a dynamic user experience\r\n* Android and Google Play Services to monitor user location and serve map media\r\n\r\nDespite the formidable challenges mentioned above, our mobile component is well on its way to being feature-complete!\r\n\r\n##Cortez in Action\r\nCortez is currently hosted at:\r\nhttps://thawing-dusk-70157.herokuapp.com\r\n\r\nIf you’re not in a playful mood, here are some screenshots of Cortez in action.\r\n\r\nStart Your Adventure:\r\nHere’s an example of a sample map:\r\n![Home](http://i.imgur.com/hMFb2qv.png)\r\nAnd the map selection page: \r\n![MapSelect](http://i.imgur.com/4EqkVb9.png)\r\nWhich yields:\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/605Lg1v.png)\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/ZEdmKuC.png)\r\n\r\nFor the mobile component: \r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/qIB4jPE.png)\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/UyEVY08.png)\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/Fz39DWj.png)\r\n\r\n##Next Steps\r\nWe have a lot ahead of us regarding the development of Cortez. Both the web and mobile applications have come a long way, but there is so much more we can do.\r\n\r\nOur next web goal is to fully integrate the users component to allow private and public maps. We also hope to implement a scavenger hunt mode in the next few weeks. At that point, the web component will have completed its feasible goals for the semester. \r\n\r\nCurrent mobile goals include synchronizing lists between the app and the database, streamlining our download process, and supporting more media types as they are added to the database. Our stretch goals include a user credentials system for private maps, and possibly map creation or modification from the mobile app.\r\n\r\n",
