<a id="what-is-cortez" class="anchor" href="#what-is-cortez" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is Cortez?</h2>

<p>Cortez is a design suite for interactive adventures; it’s a web/mobile app that allows you to create and view location-based information for exploration.
The original usage was for visitor attractions and could easily be used for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Trail Guides </li>
<li>Museum Attractions</li>
<li>City Tours</li>
<li>Or even private use!</li>
</ul>

<p>Cortez has both a web and mobile component to help easily create and view custom maps, using a Google Maps interface to allow map creators to place pins with information and media, which can then be viewed by mobile users physically at that location.
These features could help visitors stay at sites longer, learn more and become more invested in the site, and help draw younger crowds to older attractions!</p>

<h2>
<a id="mission-accomplished" class="anchor" href="#mission-accomplished" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Mission Accomplished!</h2>

<p>When we set out, we had some ambitious goals. The Web portion would create distinct maps, allowing the users to place pins, add text, video, sound, and images. They would be able to modify all of this information after the fact and save it to a database for later use. The Mobile section would load maps produced by the Web portion, integrating GPS to track the user’s location and providing pins in that area. Further, notifications would be sent if the user entered a pin’s radius.</p>

<p>All of these goals were achieved!</p>

<p>Our initial stretch goals included support for Near-Field Communications badges, but ultimately we decided that this was not an achievable goal given the time frame allotted. One Mobile stretch goal was for the pins selected by the user to provide more information if the user is within a small radius of the pin. This goal was achieved! </p>

<p>Other stretch goals included gamification, metrics, creation of maps on the Mobile app, and a password-protected user credential system. We decided against pursuing these goals, but the code is flexible enough to accommodate their addition in later versions. </p>

<a id="what-does-cortez-do" class="anchor" href="#what-does-cortez-do" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What does Cortez do?</h2>

<p>The web application is implemented through a map and pin system. Using the Google Maps API,  the user can explore different locations across the globe for where to create their map. The on-click pinning system allows map creators to mark points of interest on the map with a description and add accompanying media (pictured, audio, video, or text). Combined, these two systems provide an interface for curators to build custom maps suited to their needs and interests. The website, hosted on Heroku, also generates JSON interfaces to export to the mobile app. A fully featured user component was also implemented, allowing for private and public map editing and viewing. Although not included in the final Heroku app for compatibility with the mobile component, the user features would allow extra security for map creation. Rails easy generation of forms and gems like Paperclip allowed for a simple, clean creation of the needed features. </p>

<p>On the Mobile app, we have designed a system for displaying the maps created from the Web frontend. A Google map displays the pins, which can be selected to display their associated information. This map ties into the device’s GPS functionality, allowing the user to navigate the map in real time, walking from pin to pin. The pins will dynamically pop in and out as the user views relevant portions of the map. The pins themselves are pulled from a local JSON file. This means that the user will be able to choose which local map to use (which will tie into the map and pin system being developed on the Web application). Maps are loaded from the database, allowing for updates to the Web component to be directly reflected in the Mobile version of the map. Multiple maps are supported and can be downloaded to the phone on the fly. Pins display more information if the user is within a defined radius from the pin, and Cortez notifies a user of entering, exiting, or dwelling within a pin’s radius.</p>

<p><strong>Web Component</strong>
The features detailed about in the “What Does Cortez Do?” section are further detailed below, with screencaptures to simulate the user experience</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/qsynA8G.png" alt="">
While there are other pages, such as a home screen/help/about use, the first significant page a user is likely to encounter is the Maps page. A simple Rails index page, users have the option to show/edit/destroy any maps that have been created. The maps contain several components including a name and description. In the extended, user version, the show/edit/destroy maps would be restricted depending on the user and the public view or public edit setting. Clicking on “Show” will display the actual map. </p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/uOE2WGe.png" alt="">
As described above, the “show” button on the map index page will lead you here. It displays all current pins for that specific map, and clicking upon a pin will yield the name, description, and location, as well as an option to view the pin or edit the pin. The map is (obviously) hosted by Google Maps and created using the gem gmaps4rails. </p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/2DnbrxS.png" alt="">
Clicking on a non-pin area of the map yields a dialog asking if you want to create a pin in this location. </p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/uVnRddk.png" alt="">
Selecting to create a new pin (or edit an old pin) will lead the user here. The user has an option of entering an address instead of longitude/latitude (but one and only one can be provided. The other fields will be a name, a short description, a longer information field, as well as an area to upload different types of media like sound clips, pictures, and video. There is a separate “edit media” page for users to handle previously uploaded media individually</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/MqoAmNG.png" alt="">
The show page for the pins will show, unsurprisingly, whatever the user has uploaded or entered for the pin. </p>

<p><strong>For the mobile component:</strong>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/YlkFbG7.png" alt="">
The load screen appears when you first open, this will check for updated or new maps, by querying the web server. 
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/QJnVZEl.png" alt="">
Once loaded, users will have the ability to download specific maps. Like the web component, clicking on one of these maps will show the Google map component with pins. 
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/eMaHbTI.png" alt="">
This page will show nearby pins to a users location.
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/CMvPOPs.png" alt="">
Once users enter the geofence of a component, users will receive a notification and be able to view media content for the location.</p>

<h2>
<a id="future-goals" class="anchor" href="#future-goals" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Future Goals</h2>

<p>Although Cortez is now fairly fully featured, there are several improvements which could be made to enhance the user experience. As stated before, the website has a user component ready. Creating a fully-featured user component for the mobile side would allow for a more reliable, secure experience for map creators and viewers. With the user component added certain users could “opt-in” to track how many people are using their maps, and for how long, giving good statistics on visitors. </p>

<p>Another feature that would be useful is a a map creation mode in mobile. This would allow for more precise pin placement. Although we originally chose to create a website for map creation due to ease of entering information and ease of editing, allowing a combination of creation techniques  allow a better range for different types of users. We could also use this to implement NFC compatibility for places where high accuracy pins are needed.</p>

<h2>
<a id="conclusion" class="anchor" href="#conclusion" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Although many features could still be implemented in Cortez, the mobile and web app work together almost seamlessly, creating a easy to use map creation and viewing tool. This software suite could help keep users interested in attractions longer and help modernize tourism!</p>
